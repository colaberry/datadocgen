They are easy to train with few hyper-parameter and easy to interpret. They do have a major drawback, in that they tend to over fit the data.

The data set we are going to use can be found here -https://data.world/azel/gun-deaths-in-america. This data set is part of five thirty eight's gun deaths in America project. It contains a bunch of information about victims of gun violence. Each row of the dataset contains  the year and month of the shooting, the intent of the shooter, if cops were at the scene or not, the gender, age race and education level of the victim and finally the place where the shooting happened. There is specific information about whether the victim was Hispanic or not. We take this dataset and boil it down to predicting just one of two classes- were the victims of the shooting white or black? Why ignore the other victim classes? (There are 5 in total), firstly, the rest of the classes, as you will see, make up less than 11% of the dataset, secondly the goal is to build a simple binary classification model, for those who are interested, I would love to work with people build a more multi classification model for the whole CDC multiple causes of death dataset <br>\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', 'The plan for the analysis is as follows:\\n', '- Read and display the dataset to see what the relevant columns are.\\n', '- Encode certain categorical variables so the decision tree can be run on them.\\n', '- Plot some of the categorical variables to see how skewed they are.\\n', '- Drop rows containing non-white and non-black victims. \\n', '- Create test and train sets.\\n', '- Train the decision tree. \\n', '- Interpret the results of the tree- I will leave that as set of the question so that the interested reader can further get involved with understanding what the model represents\\n', '\\n', '### Show class values for race\\n', '\\n', 'In order to assess the values in the race class, we need to retrieve  the value counts for each of the class variables.

Here, I would like to point out that we can also make a multiclass problem by sampling the same number of rows as that of the Hispanic victims to create a 3 class classification problem.
